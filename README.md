## :calling: About

Eve-Net is an app built for connecting people to participate in outdoor community events. The app allows anyone to view nearby events and save them to their account. These events are displayed through event pages which contain various fields: event name, time, address, website, creator name, description, and covid protocols. Clicking on the website opens the website on your search engine. Clicking the address opens google maps, where you can quickly get directions to the location. These events can be easily created by dragging the blue pin to the desired location and inputting the previously mentioned fields. The app also allows you to update an event by moving the pin to the desired location and inputting the same name.
